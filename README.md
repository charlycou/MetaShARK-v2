# MetaShARK
Metadata Shiny-Automated Resources & Knowledge
_First released on 15-04-2019_  
(DOI will be updated on next release)

The aim of the MetaShARK app is to allow any user a bit familiar with ecology to fill in data packages to provide as many information as possible on any dataset used in a publication, communication, etc. in ecology. The challenge of this work is to produce a user-friendly tool to a science community which is not familiar to heavy metadata standards and their informatic specification. Consequently, the choice has been made to work only with R as it is the currentest programming language in this community and it can be easily accessible as an open source application, despite of its low performances.
This project has the ambition to offer the user a user-friendly alternative to existing tools (such as the hardcore Morpho ;) ) but also to address an other issue which is the EML is not always fully considered.
This MetaShARK git is called "v2" because it is the evolution with {golem} package of the previous [MetaShARK git](https://github.com/earnaud/MetaShARK)

**Any suggestion is welcome, feel free to contact the dev !**

## Running MetaShARK
You can launch the app through
```
library(devtools)
install_github("earnaud/MetaShARK-v2")
```

All dependencies are described in the DESCRIPTION file.

The supported features and expected behaviors are described below. 

## MetaShARK features 

### Documentation

First feature devempÃªd in MetaShARK, it is possible to consult any documented part of the Ecological Metadata Language. This documentation directly relies on the EML 2.2.0, and some tags (as the "eml-\*" ones) can be undocumented. Also, it is possible to access the original documentation through the dedicated tab.

### Metadata filling

Two methods are being developped to fill in metadata:

* Metadata Fill-In (MetaFIN) : still not accessible, it is the PNDB specific tool exploring automatic inference to fill in metadata from datasets.
* EML Assembly Line (EMLAL) : it is the EDI tool allowing the user to interact with a major part of the EML. MetaShARK is a user front-end solution to offer more automated and visual access to this tool.

### Data Package upload

It is possibe to upload data packages to metacats registered in MetaShARK. You will need to fetch your metacat token in the corresponding MetaCatUI. 

### References

Some references are given that sustain the base principles of this work.

## Releases

### Pre-Release 20200129 - EML Assembly Line (dev version)

Here it comes ! The first pre-release allowing the user to describe his dataset according to the [EML Assembly Line](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/overview.html) recommendations. Please note this version is **still in development** and some features might suffer bugs. Consequently, do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/earnaud/MetaShARK-v2/issues)

#### Features

MetaShARK/EAL supports:
* data package management (CC BY or CC 0 Licences)
* tabulated files's description (and *only* those ones yet, badly)
* automated\* tables' attributes filling
* custom units' descriptions
* automated\* categorical variables description
* geographic, taxonomic\*\* and temporal coverages
* description of persons involved (possibly through ORCID)

\* automation still requires user's verification
\*\* see Known Bugs below

#### Known Bugs

* Taxonomic coverage still suffers some errors in its core functions: see [this issue](https://github.com/EDIorg/EDIutils/issues/12)
