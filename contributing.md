# Rules for contributing to the development of MetaShARK

This document sums up rules for any user of MetaShARK who would like to either give a feedback, help on fixing some bugs, 
suggests alternatives or help in developping new features.

## Testing and giving a feedback

If you are experimenting difficulties in the use of MetaShARK, make sure this bug has not been met before. The best way to this is
to send a message to the owner of this repo.

Once you have made sure you encountered a bug, you can open an issue. Since MetaShARK is a single app, minimal reprex do not exist.
Consequently, make available those informations:

* result of `sessionInfo()`
* which branch of MetaShARK did you use
* which file did you try to describe

## Suggest alternatives

If you had a look at either the app or the code and thought some feature could be rendered in a better way (optimization, better
ergonomy) but you do not want to modify it, you can also open an issue. Please do describe *precisely* where the feature is located
(in the app AND in the code) and what the better feature could be (at least, describe the objective).

## Help on developping: fixing and new features

To help MetaShARK's development, follow those steps:

* choose an open issue from the provided list and assign yourself to it. 
* fork the repository from the `dev` branch 
* edit the code as you wish
* comment your modification into the code: stick as much as needed to the line-per-line comments, so that understanding changes can be easy
* create a pull request

If anything seem to need development, do not hesitate to contact the repository owner
